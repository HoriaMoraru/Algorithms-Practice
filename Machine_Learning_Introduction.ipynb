        "Just like chess players improve their technique by watching hundreds of games from top players, computers can be able to perform certain tasks by “looking” at data. These computers are sometimes called “**machines**” and this data observation step is also known as “**learning**”. Simple, isn’t it? So let’s define “**Machine Learning**” (ML) more formally, as stated by Tom Mitchell. A program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. Let’s get more **-h** and provide an example. Say that T is the process of playing chess, E is a set of chess matches on which the algorithm was trained and P is the probability for the program to win the next game of chess.\n",

        "What is truly important however, is that machine learning algorithms, unlike traditional ones, are not required to be pre-programmed explicitly to solve a particular task. Just like in the previous example, they **learn** from the data fed into them and afterwards, are able to **predict** results for new scenarios. As you might expect, this isn’t just black magic. The majority of ML algorithms are based on some maths and statistics, but also on a fair amount of engineering. 😎\n",
